# A-CleanAir-Greece

# Welcome!
In this Readme file you find all the necessary information about Smake it free.

## What are we doing?  
1.	We’re **collecting** information about Greek restaurants, coffee shops and bars regarding the level of smoking tobacco inside.
2.	We’re **disseminating** the collected data which allows people willing to protect their health to find the safest place nearby where the exposure to secondhand smoke is the lowest.


## Why?
Scientific evidence has unequivocally established that exposure to tobacco smoke causes death, disease and disability. There is no safe level of second-hand smoke exposure and even occasional exposure can lead to serious and often fatal diseases. In Greece, strict non-smoking laws in public places have been adopted for a long time but the implementation is lacking. As a sufficient, wide-spread tool for finding safe places is missing yet, with the help of the people our project aims to establish a more far-reaching web-platform that offers alternatives for aware people.


## How can people contribute?
If you’re living in Greece or visiting the country you can help us establishing our network by rating restaurants, coffe shops, and bars you went to in terms of their level of smoking.  


## Who are we?
At the moment, we are a team of two students from the University of Geneva: Jonas and Jonathan.
We were starting this project in the course of the Open Seventeen Challenge 2018 ([more information here](http://openseventeen.org/)) and keep working on it throughout the SDG Summer School 2018 ([more information here](http://www.gt-initiative.org/en/summer-school-2018.html)).
